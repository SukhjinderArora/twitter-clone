# Development Workflow

### Prerequisites:

To be able to run this application locally on your system, you'll need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) version 2.25 or higher
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) version 4.6.0 or higher | OR | [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) version 20.10.13 or higher AND Docker Compose version 1.29.2 or higher

### Steps to run this application locally:

1. Start by cloning the repository into your local file system.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SukhjinderArora/twitter-clone.git
   ```

2. CD in to the project directory

   ```bash
   cd twitter-clone
   ```

3. Open the repository in your favorite code editor.
4. Go into the `api` directory inside the project directory.
5. Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and set up all the environment variables mentioned in that file.
6. Now go into the `client` directory inside the project directory.
7. Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and set up all the environment variables mentioned in that file.
8. Finally run this command to start the application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres api client
   ```

9. Optionally, you can use `npx prisma db seed` to seed the database with dummy users. This command has to be executed from inside the running `api` container. To do so, run:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it twitter_clone_api /bin/bash
   ```

   **Note**: `twitter_clone_api` is the name of the `api` container in `docker-compose.yml` file.

   Once inside the container, run the following command from the terminal to seed the database:

   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

10. Shut down the application by running:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

# Deploying To Heroku

### Prerequisites:

To be able to deploy this app to Heroku, you'll need:

- An [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed on your system

### Steps to deploy this app on Heroku:

1.  To provision the PostgreSQL database add-on from the `heroku.yml` file, you'll need to switch the Heroku CLI to the beta update channel. Then install the `heroku-manifest` plugin.

    ```bash
     heroku update beta
     heroku plugins:install @heroku-cli/plugin-manifest
    ```

    **Note:** You can switch back to the stable update stream and remove the plugin at any time:

    ```bash
       heroku update stable
       heroku plugins:remove manifest
    ```

    **Note:** You can provision the database manually from the Heroku dashboard if you do not want to switch to the beta channel.

2.  Now login to Heroku by running the following command:

    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```

3.  `CD` into the project's root directory and run:

    ```bash
    heroku create <application-name> --manifest
    ```

4.  After running this command, you'll get a remote URL of a new empty Git repository on Heroku. To set that empty git repository on Heroku as the remote on your local repository, run:

    ```bash
     git remote add heroku <remote-url>
    ```

5.  `CD` into the `client` directory of the project and run the following command to build the react application:

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run build-and-move
    ```

    This command builds the React application and moves the `build` directory from the `client` directory to the `api` directory and renames it to the `public` directory.

6.  Now, `cd` into the project's root directory and run the following command to push the application to the remote Heroku repository:

    ```bash
    git subtree push --prefix api heroku main
    ```

    Because we only want to push the `api` directory to Heroku, this command will generate a new commit tree with the `api` directory as root, and push it to the remote Heroku repository.

7.  Check the logs to ensure that the application has been successfully deployed by running:

    ```bash
    heroku logs
    ```

8.  You should now be able to access the application at `https://<application-name>.herokuapp.com/` in your browser.
